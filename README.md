Bayesian estimation of information-theoretic metrics for sparsely sampled distributions


## Rationale

Reference: "Bayesian estimation of information-theoretic metrics for sparsely sampled distributions".

Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13647

## code:

Note that, by default, to run the file estimate-Shannon-entropy-example.py , you need to create, in the same folder of the funcion, two further folders:

- a folder ./functions/ for the functions.py
- a folder ./results/ where the results are saved (as .cvs dataframes)
